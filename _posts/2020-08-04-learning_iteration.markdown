What's an interesting problem you solved while learning Iteration? Explain your solution.

Iteration is the process of going throug an array and iterating on each object within that array. For example, a list of my friends would be  ['Brad', 'Vanessa', 'Jen' ,'Mark'] you would then iterate over each name within the array.
```
 ['Brad', 'Vanessa', 'Jen' ,'Mark'].each { |person| puts "#{person}" }
 
 Brad
Vanessa
Jen
Mark
```
An interesting problem I solved whille learning Iteration was when I was completing my JavaScript project. During the project I developed a CRUD movie application in which a user can add movies to a database. 
A problem I had while using API was that I had to iterate and map through all of the objects within the API. The way I solved this problem was I used the map filter to filter through all of the data I was receiving from the API.
