For my rails project, I created an application that allows a user to store and keep track of there wine collection. The app allows a user to sign up and create an account using a third party “OmniAuth”.After a user is logged in they can add a new bottle of wine to their collection. A user can add a review to each bottle in their wine cellar collection. The most rewarding part of building the project was I able to learn how signing into an app using Google, Facebook or other third-party authentication system works.
