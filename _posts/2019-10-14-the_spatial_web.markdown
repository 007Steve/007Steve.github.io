The reason why I want to learn software engineering all started with a whale! It was 2015 and I was just scrolling through Youtube and I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbpqwUUfMAQ). I immediately thought it was a projector or a fake CGI content. I did a little research into the company and found out the name of the company was [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com) and that the video was a demo of a new technology called Augmented Reality. The company was secretly working on augmented reality glasses that would enable us to view virtual  3-dimensional objects through these glasses. I knew right then and there that this is what I wanted to work on for the rest of my life. I learned as much as I could on my own for four years about what skills I would need to develop to be able to be a part of this  spatial computing revolution which led me to sites such as [Three.js]()https://threejs.org, [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/), and[ A-frame](https://aframe.io). Eventually I decided that the web was the perfect platform to distribute augmented reality content and I needed to learn how to code to take advantage of this opportunity.
