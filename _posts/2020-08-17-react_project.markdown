For my react project, I decided to develop a Netflix clone. This project was the most rewarding yet. I was so amazed at all the skills I learned during the last few months. There is so much more I would like to add to make the website function similar to Netflix. One of my next features would be to add movie trailers. The biggest challenge I faced while building this project was to render the correct movie to the show page with Dynamic Routing with React Router. Overall this project taught me a lot, I'm excited to have made it this far into my coding journey and I can't wait to learn more.
