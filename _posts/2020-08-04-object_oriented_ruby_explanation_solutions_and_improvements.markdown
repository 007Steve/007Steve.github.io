Something that I built using Object Oriented Ruby was my CLI project. I based this project on my own experiences with adopting a dog. I developed a CLI that listed common known dog breeds and provided specific information about each dog breed's nature calling it, "The World's Greatest Dog Breeds." The solution to my project would be providing information about dog breeds in general to the public in order to make choosing to adopt a certain dog easier. Certain things I could have done better during this project would be adding more information about the dogs in terms of their history, health, tempermant, and collecting data from real animal shelters.
