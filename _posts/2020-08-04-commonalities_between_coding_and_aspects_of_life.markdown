Coding relates to many aspects that occur within the real world. You can use coding for a multitidue of reasons such as developing a website, app, products, or an AI. A specific example of this would be Snapchat. Millions of individuals use this app daily but yet fail to realize the complexity that lies behind it. They see the features that the app contains being a simple task but in actuality it takes a few lines of code to be able to chat to friends for example. Additionally, you can take any object that exists within the real world and be able to program it on a computer. 
Some commonalities that I have found between coding and aspects of my own life would be using AR/VR technology where you can create a new world using spacial computing. An example would be creating any 3D model of an object in the real world and code it to behave just as it would in real life. You can also create a virtual character of an individual and use AI to program it in which it could behave like a human.
