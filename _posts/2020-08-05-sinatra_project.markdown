The second project in the Flatiron curriculum was to create a web app that uses Sinatra and Active Records. For my project I really wanted to make something that I could actually use. One of my favorite hobbies is fishing so, I figured I would make an app that tracks a user’s catches. I call it “Catch.” I know that this app isn’t anything revolutionary like Facebook or Instagram, but this is my first actual website! The excitement I get every time I view the site knowing that I built this is incredible. I know looking back in a few months that this project will seem simple and plain compared to my future projects but, as for now I’m soaking it all in. I can’t wait to improve as a developer and keep on learning new skills.
