For my javascript project, I created a CRUD application that keeps track of your favorite movies. This was by far the most challenging section in the curriculum for me. During the process, my biggest struggle was understanding the `fetch()` I made a blog talking about is if you like to check it out  https://007steve.github.io/learning_iteration. Reflecting back on my struggles I would do it all again because it taught me a lot about working with API. I look forward to my next struggles because I know it will all click eventually, **keep struggling!**
